# Web Infrastructure Design

This repository contains projects for learning web infrastructure design at Holberton School. The focus is on understanding how web servers, load balancers, and other components work together to deliver web applications.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore different web infrastructure configurations, from simple single-server setups to distributed, secured, and monitored systems.

## Tasks

* **0-simple_web_stack**: Design a one-server web infrastructure with a LAMP stack
* **1-distributed_web_infrastructure**: Design a three-server web infrastructure with load balancing
* **2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure**: Design a secured, monitored, and scalable web infrastructure
* **3-scale_up**: Scale up the infrastructure design with additional components

## Learning Objectives

* Network basics and web infrastructure
* Server roles and system redundancy
* Web server configuration and purpose
* Application server vs web server
* DNS records and role in web infrastructure
* Load balancing algorithms and implementation
* Monitoring and security best practices

## Requirements

* Whiteboard diagrams for each task
* Screenshot of each diagram saved in the repository
* Explanation of each infrastructure component
